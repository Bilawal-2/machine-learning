Convolution

Convolution is an operation that is performed on an image to extract features from it 
applying a smaller tensor called a kernel like a sliding window over the image. 
Depending on the values in the convolutional kernel, we can pick up specific patterns from the image. 


This Program is to check horizontal and vertical edges in an image using appropriate kernels.
